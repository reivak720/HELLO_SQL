ship_status A calculated column that contains a value of SHIPPED or NOT SHIPPED

order_id The order_id column

order_date The order_date column


If the order has a value in the ship_date column, the ship_status column 
should contain a value of SHIPPED. Otherwise, it should contain a value of NOT SHIPPED.
Sort the final result set by the order_date column.
